# Tasks Manager

### Description

Task manager use local storage to cache your tasks. You can add new tasks, edit old ones. When your task is done you can check it. When you change your mind, you can undone task. The app allows you to change: deadline date, task title and status.

The app was build using react. I'm not using react router dom library in purpose. My goal was to build an app without any libraries (except React ;) ), to see problems occuring during making this process.
